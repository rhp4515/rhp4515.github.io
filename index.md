<div class="lead">
I’m a technology leader with 9 years of experience building systems that scale — not just in throughput, but in capability and autonomy. My work centers on turning complex, legacy infrastructure into resilient, self-service platforms that empower teams to move faster with confidence.
</div>

### Network Automation

I began my journey in network automation, building frameworks to collect device health data and a self-service portal that automated routine operational runbooks. From there, I helped migrate a heavily used client transaction database to a modern, high-performance platform — ensuring business continuity while setting the foundation for future growth.

### Middleware & Infrastructure

My next chapter focused on middleware infrastructure at enterprise scale — managing **RabbitMQ** and **Kafka** clusters on-premise, and developing tools that allowed application teams to configure, package, and deploy services independently.

### Financial Systems & Enterprise Products

Today, I lead the team responsible for re-architecting and scaling Bloomberg's Enterprise Product pipelines — enabling **buyside and sellside clients** to deliver orders and transactions reliably into Bloomberg OMS. We've expanded this platform to include **REST-based ingestion APIs** and **Pub/Sub infrastructure** for managing client subscriptions across diverse financial workflows.

### Philosophy & Focus

Across every role, my focus has been consistent: build systems that are _resilient, observable, and evolvable_ — and create engineering environments where teams can deliver efficiently. I’m driven by clarity, automation, and the belief that the best technology quietly enables everyone around it to do more.
